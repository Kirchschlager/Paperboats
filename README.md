# Paperboats

Paperboats is a parallelized, grid-based post-processing code to compute the evolution of dust material in a moving gas. Based on the output of an MHD code – which provides all required information of the gas phase – the dust transport, dust destruction and potential dust growth is calculated. The code was originally developed to study the destruction of dust grains in a clumpy supernova remnant, however, it was also applied to study the dust destruction of a supernova blastwave in a turbulet ISM or in a turbulent ISM without supernova blastwave.
